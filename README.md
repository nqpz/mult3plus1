# mult3plus1

Try running `stack install` and then `mult3plus1 N`, where N is a
positive integer.  This program will try to find the fraction of all
positive integers modulo N that are guaranteed to become smaller when
run through the calculation of the [the Collatz
conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture).


## Background

I tried to prove the conjecture in July 2019 by programming my way out
of it, but I didn't succeed.
